# ~ FunkScammers ~

A Reddit bot that works with the Reddit API through [PRAW](https://praw.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and tries to prevent scammers in certain (and how I think, most vulnerable subreddits).



## Documentation

Version: 0.0.1 (Beta)

The application is still under construction.
More documentation will be added later!


## FAQ

#### ~ Where this bot operates?

The bot operates on the subs it folllows

#### ~ What the bot tries to detect?

The bot, with the help of [en_core_web_lg model](https://www.datasciencelearner.com/how-to-install-en_core_web_lg-spacy-model/) tries to detect posts/comments/replies (based on their [Semantic similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_similarity) between a bunch of samples) that seem sus and replies to them

#### ~ Why these subreddits?

The bot mostly follows *learning related* subreddits where I, as the author, personally think that enthusiastic people that want to learn something, may fall to a trap on some *great offer* / *fast learning opportunity* that seems to good to be true
